## 📋 Issues Addressed and Resolved

### 1. 🚦 Rate Limiting Fine-tuning ✅ COMPLETED

**Problem**: Rate limiting system needed production fine-tuning and proper integration.

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Enhanced `apply_rate_limiting()` function with settings integration
- ✅ Added endpoint-specific rate limiting with configurable limits
- ✅ Implemented proper error logging and client tracking
- ✅ Added debug function `get_rate_limit_status()` for troubleshooting
- ✅ Rate limiting now uses configuration values from settings

**Configuration**:
- Quiz Generation: 10 requests per 5 minutes
- Question Generation: 30 requests per 5 minutes
- Content Ingestion: 20 requests per 5 minutes
- Default: 60 requests per minute

**Files Modified**:
- `/app/auth.py` - Enhanced rate limiting implementation
- Added proper settings integration and error handling

### 2. 🤖 OpenAI API Key Configuration ✅ COMPLETED

**Problem**: Quiz generation required proper OpenAI API key configuration for DSPy.

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Created `configure_openai.py` - Interactive configuration script
- ✅ Enhanced DSPy configuration with better error handling
- ✅ Added environment variable support with fallbacks
- ✅ Implemented OpenAI connection testing
- ✅ Added DSPy integration verification

**Features Added**:
- Interactive API key setup
- Automatic .env file creation
- Connection testing with OpenAI API
- DSPy integration verification
- Sample question generation testing

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `configure_openai.py` - New configuration tool
- `/app/dspy_quiz_generator.py` - Enhanced error handling and configuration

### 3. 🌐 Response Parsing Improvements ✅ COMPLETED

**Problem**: Response parsing had issues with NoneType errors and needed better error handling.

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Enhanced JSON parsing with safe fallbacks
- ✅ Added comprehensive error handling for all response types
- ✅ Implemented timeout and connection error handling
- ✅ Added detailed error messages and response structure validation
- ✅ Created robust response parsing that handles edge cases

**Improvements Made**:
- Safe JSON parsing with try/catch blocks
- Detailed error messages for different failure modes
- Timeout handling for slow responses
- Connection error detection and reporting
- Response structure validation

**Files Modified**:
- `test_api.py` - Enhanced with improved response parsing
