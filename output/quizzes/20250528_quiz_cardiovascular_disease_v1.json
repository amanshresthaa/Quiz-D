        "question_text": "During which phase of the cardiac cycle does the \"atrial kick\" occur, contributing to ventricular filling?",
        "question_type": "multiple_choice",
        "answer_text": "Atrial Systole (Late Diastole)",
        "choices": [
          "1. Ventricular Filling (Early Diastole)",
          "2. Atrial Systole (Late Diastole)",
          "3. Isovolumetric Contraction",
          "4. Ventricular Ejection"
        ],
        "difficulty": "medium",
        "explanation": "The \"atrial kick\" occurs during Atrial Systole (Late Diastole), which contributes the final 30% of ventricular filling. This phase is characterized by the contraction of the atria, which pushes blood into the ventricles, increasing their volume just before ventricular contraction begins.",

During systole, the heart contracts and the semilunar valves are open, which limits blood flow to the coronary arteries. Therefore, the correct answer is diastole.",
