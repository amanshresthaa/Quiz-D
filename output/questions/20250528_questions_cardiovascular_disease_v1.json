      "difficulty": "medium",
      "explanation": "Coronary perfusion primarily occurs during diastole, which is the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle. During this time, the heart muscle receives blood supply, as the coronary arteries are perfused when the heart is relaxed and the semilunar valves are closed. In contrast, during systole, the heart contracts and the coronary arteries are compressed, limiting blood flow.",
