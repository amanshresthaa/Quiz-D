CARDIAC CYCLE OVERVIEW
======================

The cardiac cycle represents the complete sequence of events during one heartbeat, typically lasting 0.8 seconds at rest (heart rate ~75 bpm). The cycle consists of two major phases:

1. SYSTOLE (Contraction Phase) - Duration: ~0.3 seconds
   - Ventricular systole: Ventricles contract and eject blood
   - Atrial systole occurs at the end of diastole

2. DIASTOLE (Relaxation Phase) - Duration: ~0.5 seconds
   - Ventricular filling occurs
   - Coronary perfusion primarily happens during this phase

DETAILED CARDIAC CYCLE PHASES
============================

Phase 1: Ventricular Filling (Early Diastole)
- AV valves open (tricuspid and mitral)
- Semilunar valves closed (aortic and pulmonary)
- Passive ventricular filling (~70% of total filling)
- Ventricular pressure: 0-5 mmHg
- Atrial pressure: 2-8 mmHg

Phase 2: Atrial Systole (Late Diastole)
- "Atrial kick" contributes final 30% of ventricular filling
- P wave on ECG represents atrial depolarization
- Ventricular pressure rises slightly to 8-10 mmHg

Phase 3: Isovolumetric Contraction
- QRS complex triggers ventricular contraction
- All valves closed momentarily
- Ventricular pressure rises rapidly without volume change
- Duration: ~0.05 seconds

Phase 4: Ventricular Ejection
- Ventricular pressure exceeds arterial pressure
- Semilunar valves open
- Stroke volume ejected (~70ml per ventricle)
- Peak ventricular pressure: ~120 mmHg (left), ~25 mmHg (right)

Phase 5: Isovolumetric Relaxation
- T wave represents ventricular repolarization
- Semilunar valves close (S2 heart sound)
- Ventricular pressure drops rapidly
- All valves closed briefly

PRESSURE-VOLUME RELATIONSHIPS
=============================

Left Ventricular Pressure-Volume Loop:
- End Diastolic Volume (EDV): ~120-130 ml
- End Systolic Volume (ESV): ~50-60 ml
- Stroke Volume (SV): EDV - ESV = ~70 ml
- Ejection Fraction (EF): SV/EDV = ~55-65%

Key Pressure Values:
- Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure: 8-12 mmHg
- Aortic systolic pressure: 100-140 mmHg
- Aortic diastolic pressure: 60-90 mmHg
- Mean arterial pressure: (Systolic + 2×Diastolic)/3

HEART SOUNDS AND MURMURS
=======================

S1 Heart Sound ("Lub"):
- Caused by closure of AV valves (mitral and tricuspid)
- Marks beginning of systole
- Best heard at apex for mitral, left sternal border for tricuspid

S2 Heart Sound ("Dub"):
- Caused by closure of semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary)
- Marks beginning of diastole
- May split during inspiration (A2 before P2)

Pathological Sounds:
- S3 gallop: Ventricular gallop, indicates heart failure
- S4 gallop: Atrial gallop, indicates decreased ventricular compliance
- Murmurs: Turbulent blood flow through valves

REGULATION OF CARDIAC OUTPUT
===========================

Cardiac Output (CO) = Heart Rate (HR) × Stroke Volume (SV)
Normal CO: ~5-6 L/min at rest

Factors Affecting Heart Rate:
1. Sympathetic stimulation: Increases HR via β1-adrenergic receptors
2. Parasympathetic stimulation: Decreases HR via muscarinic receptors
3. Circulating catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine)
4. Temperature, electrolyte imbalances, medications

Factors Affecting Stroke Volume:
1. PRELOAD (Frank-Starling Mechanism):
   - Venous return determines EDV
   - Increased preload → increased contractility
   - Optimal sarcomere length: 2.0-2.2 μm

2. AFTERLOAD:
   - Resistance against which ventricle must pump
   - Increased afterload → decreased stroke volume
   - Primarily determined by systemic vascular resistance

3. CONTRACTILITY (Inotropy):
   - Intrinsic ability of myocardium to contract
   - Enhanced by: Sympathetic stimulation, calcium, digitalis
   - Impaired by: Heart failure, ischemia, negative inotropes

CORONARY CIRCULATION
===================

Coronary Blood Flow:
- ~250 ml/min at rest (5% of cardiac output)
- Can increase 4-5 fold during exercise
- Primarily occurs during diastole (80-90%)

Coronary Arteries:
- Right Coronary Artery (RCA): Supplies right ventricle, inferior LV wall
- Left Anterior Descending (LAD): Supplies anterior LV wall, septum
- Left Circumflex (LCX): Supplies lateral and posterior LV wall

Metabolic Regulation:
- Adenosine: Primary metabolic vasodilator
- Oxygen extraction: 60-70% (very high compared to other organs)
- Autoregulation maintains constant flow despite pressure changes

CLINICAL CORRELATIONS
====================

Myocardial Infarction (MI):
- Result of coronary artery occlusion
- ST-elevation MI (STEMI): Complete vessel occlusion
- Non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI): Partial occlusion
- Troponin elevation indicates myocardial necrosis

Heart Failure:
- Systolic HF: Reduced ejection fraction (<40%)
- Diastolic HF: Preserved ejection fraction (>50%)
- Compensatory mechanisms: Increased heart rate, vasoconstriction

Valvular Disease:
- Stenosis: Narrowed valve opening
- Regurgitation: Incompetent valve closure
- Affects preload, afterload, and cardiac output

KEY PHARMACOLOGY
===============

Beta Blockers:
- Block β1-adrenergic receptors
- Decrease heart rate and contractility
- Examples: Metoprolol, Propranolol, Atenolol

ACE Inhibitors:
- Block angiotensin-converting enzyme
- Reduce afterload and preload
- Examples: Lisinopril, Enalapril, Captopril

Calcium Channel Blockers:
- Block L-type calcium channels
- Reduce contractility and vascular tone
- Examples: Amlodipine, Diltiazem, Verapamil

Digitalis/Digoxin:
- Inhibits Na+/K+-ATPase pump
- Increases intracellular calcium
- Positive inotropic effect
